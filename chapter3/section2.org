* Derivatives

* Paradox of Generalization

In calculus, sometimes generalization makes a problem easier instead
of harder. This is called as /paradox of generalization/.

* Definition 3.2.1

For any function $f$, the derivative of $f$ is the function $f'(x)$
defined by the formula

$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$

- The domain of $f'$ is the set of all values of $x$ for which this
  limit is defined.
- If $a$ is in the domain of $f'$, then we say that $f$ is
  /differentiable$ at $a$.
- $f'(a)$ is the rate of change of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ at
  $x=a$, which is also the slope of the line tangent to the graph of
  $f$ at the point $(a,f(a))$.
- The process of finding the derivative of a function is called
  differentiation.
- If $I$ is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Terminology][open interval]], we say that $f$ is differentiable on $I$
  if it is differentiable at $a$ for every number $a \in I$.

* Theorem 3.2.3

Suppose $f$ is differentiable at $a$. Then

$f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$

* Theorem 3.2.4

If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continous at $a$.
