* Derivative Rules

** Theorem 3.3.1

Constant functions and the identity functions are differentiable at
all numbers, and their derivatives are given by the following
formulas:

- Suppose $f$ is a constant function; that is, there is some number
  $c$ such that $f(x)=c$. Then $f'(x)=0$. In other words,
  $\dfrac{d}{dx}(c) = 0$.
- Suppose $f$ is the identity function; that is, $f(x)=x$. Then
  $f'(x)=1$. In other words, $\dfrac{d}{dx}(x) = 1$.

** Theorem 3.3.2

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are functions and $c$ is a number.

- If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at a number $x$, then so is $f +
  g$, and

  $(f+g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$

  In other words,

  $\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)+g(x)) = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) + \dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))$

- If $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then so is $cf$, and

  $(cf)'(x) = c(f'(x))$

  In other words,

  $\dfrac{d}{dx}(cf(x)) = c.\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))$

- If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at a number $x$, then so is $f -
  g$, and

  $(f-g)'(x) = f'(x)-g'(x)$

  In other words,

  $\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)-g(x)) = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) - \dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))$
