* The Chain Rule

** Theorem 3.4.1 (Chain Rule)

If $g$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(x)$,
then $f \circ g$ is differentiable at $x$, and

$(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$

In other words,

$\dfrac{d}{dx} (f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))\dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))$

We can streamline our use of the chain rule by noticing the
relationship between the following two equations:

$\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) = f'(x)$

$\dfrac{d}{dx} (f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))\dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))$

The first equations says that the derivation of $f(x)$ is
$f'(x)$. Replacing $x$ with the expression $g(x)$ on both sides, you
might expect that the derivative of $f(g(x))$ would be $f'(g(x))$. The
chain rule says that this is part of the answer, but it's not the
whole thing. To get the correct answer you need to multiply by the
derivative of $g(x)$
