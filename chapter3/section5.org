* Implicit Differentitation

The technique of implicit differentiation allows you to find the
derivative of y with respect to x without having to solve the given
equation for y. The chain rule must be used whenever the function y is
being differentiated because of our assumption that y may be expressed
as a function of x.

** Theorem 3.5.1

Suppose that $I$ is an open interval, and for every number $x$ in the
interval $I$, $f(x) = g(x)$. Then for every number $x$ in $I$, $f'(x)
= g'(x)$, where we interepret this equation to mean that either both
derivatives are defined and they are equal, or both are undefined.
