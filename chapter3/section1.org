* Rate of Changes and Slopes

** Definition 3.1.1

Suppose two quantities $x$ and $y$ are related by the equation $y =
f(x)$. We say that the /average rate of change of y with respect to x
over the interval $[a,b]$/ is

$\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$

** Definition 3.1.2

Suppose two quantities $x$ and $y$ are related by the equation $y =
f(x)$. If the limit

$\lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$

is defined, the we say that it is the /instantaneous rate of change of
y with respect to x at $x=a$/.

- Sometimes the word instantaneous is left and it is simply called as
  /rate of change of y with respect to x at $x=a$/.
- If rate of change of y is not explicitly specified to be an average
  rate of change, then it is understood to be an instantaneous rate of
  change.
- The instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ at $x=a$
  could also be though of as slope of the line tangent to the graph of
  $f$ at the point $P= (a,f(a))$
