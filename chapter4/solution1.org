$P = 25 I^2$

At $t = t_1$,

$I = 4$ amperes

$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = 2$  amps/ min

$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = ?$

$P = 25I^2$

$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 50 * \dfrac{dI}{dt}$

$= 50 I \dfrac{dI}{dt}$

At $t_1$,

$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 50 * 4 *  2 = 400$  W/min

The power is increasing 400 W/min.

$V =$ Volume of gas in cyclinder in cubic inches

$P =$ Pressure of gas in kilopascals

$P = \dfrac{3000}{V}$

At $t = t_1$,

$V = 20$ cubic inches.

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = 3$  $in^3/sec$

$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = ?$

$P = \dfrac{3000}{V}$

$P = 3000 V^{-1}$

$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 3000 * (-1)V^{-2} \dfrac{dV}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = 3000 * -1 * (20)^-2 * 3$

$= \dfrac{-3000}{20^2} * 3 = -22.5$ kp/sec.

$\dfrac{dr}{dt} = ?$

$V = \dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3$

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = \dfrac{4}{3} \pi 3r^2 \dfrac{dr}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \dfrac{dr}{dt}$

At $t_1$,

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \dfrac{dr}{dt}$

$5 = 4\pi (3^2) \dfrac{dr}{dt}$

x = Length of Alice's shardow in feet

y = Distance between Alice and street light

We need to prove $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ is constant.

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 2 ft/s$

Using the property of similar triangle,

$\dfrac{9}{y + x} = \dfrac{5}{x}$

$9x = 5y + 5x$

$4x = 5y$

$4 \dfrac{dx}{dt} = 5 \dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{5dy}{4dt} = \dfrac{5}{4} * 2 = 2.5$ ft/s

So, $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ is constant and it is getting longer as $2.5 >

x = Alice's height in feets

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = -2f/min$

y = Alice's shadow in feets

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = ?$

Using the property of similar triangle,

$\dfrac{9}{8 + y} = \dfrac{x}{y}$

$9y = 8x + xy$

$9\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 8\dfrac{dx}{dt} + x\dfrac{dy}{dt} + y \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt}(9-x) = \dfrac{dx}{dx}(8+y)$

At $x=3$ feet,

$\dfrac{dy}{dt}(9-x) = \dfrac{dx}{dt}(8+y)$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} * 6 = -2 (8+y)$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = -\dfrac{8+y}{3}$

We already know that

$\dfrac{9}{8+y} = \dfrac{x}{y} = \dfrac{3}{y}$

$9y = 24 + 3y$

$6y = 24$

$y = 4$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{-(8+y)}{3} = \dfrac{-12}{3} = -4$ ft/min

The shadow is decreasing 4 feet per min.

x = distance between building and car in feets

y = distance between the road and the car in feets

We need to find $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ when $y = 100$

$x^2 = 50^2 + y^2$

$2x\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{y}{x} * \dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 30 ft/sec$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{y}{x} \dfrac{dy}{dt}$

We know that

$x^2 = 50^2 + y^2$

$x^2 = 50^2 + 100^2 = 2500 + 10000$

$x^2 = 12500$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{100}{12500} \dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{1}{125} * 30 = 30/125$

At $y = 12$ feet, $\dfrac{dy}{dt} = ?$

$15^2 = x^2 + y^2$

$0 = 2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} + 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$15^2 = x^2 + 12^2$

$x^2 = 15^2 - 12^2 = 81$

$x = 9$

$2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} + 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 0$

$2*9*2 + 2*12*\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 0$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{-2*9*2}{2*12} = \dfrac{-2*9}{12} = \dfrac{-3}{2} = -1.5$ ft/s

The top of the ladder is sliding down at $1.5$ feet per second.

Bottom of the ladder is fixed.

y = Distance between the top of the ladder and the wall in feets.

x = Distance between the ladder.

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 2$ ft/s

At $x = 5$ feet, $\dfrac{dy}{dt} = ?$

$x^2 = 3^2 + y^2$

$5^2 = 3^2 + y^2$

$y^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 16$

$y = 4$

$x^2 = 3^2 + y^2$

$2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} = 2y\dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$2*5*2 = 2*4* \dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{2*5*2}{2*4} = \dfrac{5}{2} = 2.5$ ft/s

The ladder is sliding up the wall at $2.5$ ft/s when the ladder is 5

$\tan \theta = \dfrac{x}{x}$

$\sec^2 \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{dx}{dt} * \dfrac{1}{2}$

y = Distance between the camera and the top of the rocket.

$y^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 = 5$

$y = \sqrt{5}$

$\cos \theta = \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$

$\cos^2 \theta = \dfrac{4}{5}$

$\sec^2 \theta = \dfrac{5}{4}$

$\sec^2 \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{dx}{dt} * \dfrac{1}{2}$

$\dfrac{5}{4} * 0.1 = \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$\dfrac{5}{4} * 0.1 = \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$\dfrac{5}{4} * 0.1 = \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{0.5}{4} * 2 = \dfrac{0.5}{2} = \dfrac{5}{20} = \dfrac{1}{4}$

$\theta =$ Angle between the police and car in radians.

x = Distance between car and the shortedst distance between road and
police.

At $\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{3}$, $\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{1}{20}$ rad/s

Speed limit of road = 65mph

Since sum of angle inside the triangle is 180,

$\dfrac{\pi}{3} + \dfrac{\pi}{2} + a = 180$

$\dfrac{2\pi + 3\pi}{6} + a = 2\pi$

$a = 2\pi - \dfrac{5\pi}{6} = \dfrac{12\pi}{6} - \dfrac{5\pi}{6}$

$a = \dfrac{7\pi}{6}$

$\tan \dfrac{7\pi}{6} = \dfrac{1/10}{x} = \dfrac{1}{10x}$

$x = \dfrac{1}{10 \tan (7\pi/6)} = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{10}$

We know that,

$\tan(\pi - \dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta) = \dfrac{1/10}{x}$

$\tan (\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta) = \dfrac{1}{10x}$

$\cot \theta = \dfrac{1}{10x}$

$\cot \theta = \dfrac{1}{10}x^{-1}$

$-\csc^2 \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = -\dfrac{1}{10}x^{-2}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$-\csc^2 \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = -\dfrac{1}{10} (\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{10})^{-2}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$-(\dfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}})^2 \dfrac{1}{20} = -\dfrac{1}{10} (\dfrac{10}{\sqrt{3}})^{2}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$-\dfrac{4}{3} \dfrac{1}{20} = -\dfrac{1}{10} * \dfrac{10^2}{3} \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$-\dfrac{1}{15} = \dfrac{-10}{3} \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$V = \dfrac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h = \dfrac{1}{3} \pi h^3$

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = \dfrac{3h^2}{3} \pi \dfrac{dh}{dt} = h^2 \pi \dfrac{dh}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 60$ mph

z = Distance between the van and the police vehicle.

$z^2 = x^2 + y^2$

We need to find $\dfrac{dz}{dt}$ at $t = t_1$

$2z \dfrac{dz}{dt} = 2x\dfrac{dx}{dt} + 2y\dfrac{dy}{dt}$

$z^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 13$

$z = \sqrt{13}$

$2\sqrt{13} \dfrac{dz}{dt} = 2*2*80 + 2*3*60$

x = Distance between the first base and the runner.

y = Distance between the home plate and the point of a runner.

*** Solution a

At $x=30$ feet

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = ?$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 20 ft/s$

By pythagoras theorem,

$y^2 = x^2 + 90^2$

$2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 2x\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{2.30}{2.y} 20 = \dfrac{600}{y}$

$y^2 = x^2 + 90^2$

$y^2 = 30^2 + 90^2 = 9000$

$y = \sqrt{9000}$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{600}{y} = \dfrac{600}{\sqrt{9000}} = \dfrac{600}{3*10\sqrt{10}}$

$= \dfrac{20}{\sqrt{10}} = \dfrac{2.10}{\sqrt{10}} = 2\sqrt{10}$ ft/sec

*** Solution b

z = Distance between the runner and the pitcher's mound.

Let distance between pitcher mound and first base be $a$

$a^2 + a^2 = 90^2$

$2a^2 = 90^2$

$a^2 = \dfrac{90^2}{2} = \dfrac{90.90}{2}$

$a = \dfrac{9.10}{\sqrt{2}} = \dfrac{90}{\sqrt{2}}$

Angle between the pitcher mound and the second base = $\angle{45}$

Since it's not a right triange, we will use the law of cosines.

$z^2 = a^2 + (90-x)^2 - 2a(90-x) \cos 45$

Differentitating,

$2z\dfrac{dz}{dt} = 2(90-x)(-\dfrac{dx}{dt}) + 2a\cos(45) \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

Putting $x=30$,

$2z\dfrac{dz}{dt} = 2.60.-20 + \dfrac{2.90.1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}.20$

$2z\dfrac{dz}{dt} = -2400 + 1800$

$2z\dfrac{dz}{dt} = -600$

$\dfrac{dz}{dt} = -\dfrac{300}{2}$

Using the law of cosines, let's fine $z$

$z^2 = a^2 + (90-x)^2 - 2a(90-x) \cos 45$

$= \dfrac{90^2}{2} + 60^2 - \dfrac{2.90.60.1}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}$

$= 4050 + 3600 - 5400$

$= 2250$

$z = \sqrt{2250}$

$\dfrac{dz}{dt} = \dfrac{-300}{\sqrt{2250}} = \dfrac{-300}{5.3.\sqrt{10}}$

$= \dfrac{-100}{5.\sqrt{10}} = \dfrac{-20}{\sqrt{10}} = -2\sqrt{10}$ ft/s

a = Distance between the person and the base of the ferris wheel.

$a = \theta(t)$

Using law of cosines,

$a^2 = 60^2 + 60^2 - 2.60.60 \cos \theta$

$a^2 = 2.60^2 - 2.60^2 \cos \theta$

$a^2 = 60^2(2-2\cos \theta)$

$a = 60\sqrt{2-2\cos \theta}$

Differentitating it,

$\dfrac{da}{dt} = 60(2-2\cos \theta)^{-1/2} (-2 * -\sin \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt})$

$= \dfrac{60}{\sqrt{2-2\cos \theta}} * 2\sin \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$

$\dfrac{da}{dt} = \dfrac{120\sin \theta}{\sqrt{2-2\cos \theta}} \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$

It takes 30 minutes to complete one revolution. So to cover $2\pi$
radians, it took 30 minutes.

$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{2\pi}{30} = \dfrac{\pi}{15}$ radians/minutes

When the passenger is 90 meteres above the base of the wheel, we need
to find $\theta$.

$\sin \alpha = \dfrac{30}{60} = \dfrac{1}{2}$

$\alpha = \dfrac{\pi}{6}$ radians

$\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{6} + \dfrac{\pi}{2} = \dfrac{2\pi}{3}$

$\sin (\dfrac{2\pi}{3}) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

$\cos (\dfrac{2\pi}{3}) = \dfrac{-1}{2}$

$\dfrac{da}{dt} = \dfrac{120. \sqrt{3}/2}{\sqrt{2+ \dfrac{1}{2}}} . \dfrac{\pi}{15}$

$= \dfrac{60\sqrt{3}\pi \sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5}.15} = \dfrac{60.2.\sqrt{3}\pi}{15 \sqrt{5}}$

$y^2 = x^2 + 100^2$

Differentitating it,

$2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 2x \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 2x . 40 = 80x$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 40\dfrac{x}{y}$

At $x=50$,

$y^2 = 50^2 + 100^2 = 12500$

$y = \sqrt{12500}$

We need to find $\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$ at $x=50$

$\cos \theta = \dfrac{x}{x}$

$y \cos \theta = x$

Differentitating it,

$y * -\sin \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} + cos \theta \dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$-y\sin \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} + \cos \theta \dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

At $x = 50$,

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 40$ ft/s

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{40x}{y} = \dfrac{40.50}{\sqrt{12500}} = \dfrac{40.50}{10.\sqrt{125}}$

$= \dfrac{40.50}{10.5\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{40}{\sqrt{5}}$

$\cos \theta = \dfrac{50}{\sqrt{12500}} = \dfrac{50}{10.5\sqrt{5}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$

$\sin \theta = \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$

$50 \sqrt{5} \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\dfrac{40}{\sqrt{5}} = 40$

$100\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} \theta + \dfrac{40}{5} = 40$

$100 \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = 32$

x = Distance between the boat and the dock

y = Distance between the bow of the boat and the man's hand.

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = -4 ft/s$

At $x=12$, $\dfrac{dx}{dt} = ?$

$y^2 = x^2 + 25$

$2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 2x\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$2y * - 4 = 2x\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = -\dfrac{8y}{2x} = \dfrac{-4y}{x}$

$y^2 = x^2 + 25$

$y^2 = 12^2 + 25 = 169$

$y = \sqrt{169} = 13$

$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = -4 * \dfrac{13}{12} = \dfrac{-13}{3} \approx -4.33$ ft/s

Board has a circular hole with 3 inch radius.

Distance between the table top and the light bulb is 20 inches.

x = Distance between light bulb and the board.

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = -5 $ inches/sec

$A =$ Area of the lighted region

At $x = 10$, $\dfrac{dA}{dt} = ?$

The area depends on two parameters: x and r where r is the radius of
the lighted region.

Note that $r$ also changes with time and depends on $x$.

By similar triangle law,

$\dfrac{3}{x} = \dfrac{r}{20}$

$A = \pi {r^2}$

$= \pi * \dfrac{60^2}{x^2} = 60^2 \pi x^{-2}$

$A = 60^2 \pi x^{-2}$

$\dfrac{dA}{dt} = 60^2 \pi * -2x^{-3} \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

Trough dimensions:

- (h) Height: 3 feet
- (l) Length: 5 feet

At noon, the water in trough was

1.5 deep

h = Height of the trough

$\dfrac{dh}{dt} = 0.1$ ft/hr

*** Solution a

At noon,

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = ?$

Volume = Area of triange * length of triangle

$= \dfrac{1}{2} w*h*$ length of trough

$= \dfrac{1}{2}whl$

As $t$ changes, $l$ is constant but both $h$ and $w$ changes.

$= \dfrac{1}{2}whl = 2.5 wh$

Now let's try to elimiate $w$ from the equation. Using law of similar
triangle,

$\dfrac{2}{3} = \dfrac{w}{h}$

$V = 2.5 wh = 2.5 * \dfrac{2}{3} * h^2 = \dfrac{5}{3} h^2$

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = \dfrac{5}{3}.2h \dfrac{dh}{dt}$

$= \dfrac{5}{3}.2.h * 0.1 = h*5*\dfrac{2}{3}*\dfrac{1}{10}$

$= \dfrac{h}{3} = \dfrac{1.5}{3} = \dfrac{15}{3.10} = \dfrac{5}{10}$

$= 0.5$ feet^3/hr

*** Solution b

At noon, $h = 1.5$ feet

Noon = 12 PM

We know that the water was filling at a constant rate of $0.1$ ft/hr

So far it to fill $1.5$ feet, it would have taken $\dfrac{1.5}{0.1} = 15$ hours.

So it started raining 15 hours before noon.

Using similar triangle property,

$\dfrac{S}{h} = \dfrac{756}{455}$

$V = \dfrac{1}{3}(\dfrac{756}{455})^2 * h^3$

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = (\dfrac{756}{455})^2h^2\dfrac{dh}{dt}$

$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = (\dfrac{756}{455})^2(406)^2*\dfrac{dh}{dt}$

$\theta = \arctan (-9/5) = -1.06$ radians

$\sec \theta = \dfrac{\sqrt{106}}{5}$

$\sec^2 \theta = \dfrac{106}{25}$

$\dfrac{106}{25}\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = 3.3(3^2-4)^{-2}(2.3).3 - \dfrac{3}{3^2-4}*3$

$\dfrac{106}{25}\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{9}{25}*2.3.3 - \dfrac{3}{5}*3$

$\dfrac{106}{25}\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{162}{25} - \dfrac{9}{5} = \dfrac{162}{25} - \dfrac{45}{25}$

So $\theta$ is increasing.

*** Solution b

$\sec^2 \theta \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = 3x(x^2-4)^{-2}(2x)\dfrac{dx}{dt} - \dfrac{3}{x^2-4}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

At $x=1$,

$\tan \theta = \dfrac{-3.1}{1-4} = \dfrac{-3}{-3} = 1$

$\sec \theta = \sec(\arctan(1)) = \sqrt{2}$

$\sec^2 \theta = 2$

$2\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = 3.1(1-4)^{-2}(2.1)\dfrac{dx}{dt} - \dfrac{3}{1-4}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

$2\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = \dfrac{3}{(-3)^2} * 2 * 3 - \dfrac{3}{-3}*3$

$2\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = 2+3 = 5$

$\dfrac{d\theta}{dt} = 2.5$ radians/s

$\theta$ is still increasing.
