* Sophisticated Graphing

** General procedure for graphing

These are the the general steps while you try to compute the graph of
a function $f$:

1. Determine domain of the $f$
2. Find $f'(x)$ and use it to determine intervals on which $f$ is
  increasing or decreasing, and local maximum or minimum points.
3. Find $f''(x)$ and use it to determine intervals on which $f$ is
  [[file:section4.org][concave up or down, and inflection points.]]
4. Use limits to find all vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
5. Plot important points and sketch the curve!
