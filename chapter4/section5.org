* Sophisticated Graphing

** General procedure for graphing

These are the the general steps while you try to compute the graph of
a function $f$:

1. Determine domain of the $f$
2. Find $f'(x)$ and use it to determine intervals on which $f$ is
  increasing or decreasing, and local maximum or minimum points.
3. Find $f''(x)$ and use it to determine intervals on which $f$ is
  [[file:section4.org][concave up or down, and inflection points.]]
4. Use limits to find all vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
5. Plot important points and sketch the curve!

Notes:

- If $f(x)$ is undefined at some point, investigate what happens when
  $x$ approaches the point from it's left and right side.
- If the limit of the above computation is infinity (with different
  signs) on different directions, they you have a vertical asymptotes.
- To check for horizontal asymptote, you can compute the limit of the
  function with $x \to \infty$ and $x \to -\infty$ and see if they
  give the same value.
