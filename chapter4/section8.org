* L'Hopital's Rule

** L'Hopital's Rule (Theorem 4.8.1)

Suppose that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$. If

$\lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$,

then

$\lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L$,

L'Hopital's rule can also be used for one-side limits and limits as
$x$ approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$. And it can be also used if we
find that the limit of $f'(x)/g'(x)$ is $\infty$ or $-\infty$; in this
case, once again, the same conclusion applies to the limit of
$f(x)/g(x)$. (You can see example 4.8.4 for a sample)

** L'Hopital's Rule, Part 2 (Theorem 4.8.6)

Suppose that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty$ or $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) =
-\infty$, and also either $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \infty$ or $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) =
-\infty$. If

$\lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$,

then

$\lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L$,

As before, the same rule applies to one sided limits and limits as $x$
approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$, and it also applies if $L$ is
replaced by either $\infty$ or $-\infty$.

** Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 4.8.8)

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are continous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable
on $(a,b)$ and for all $x \in (a,b), g'(x) \neq 0$. There there is a
number $c$ such that $a < c < b$ and

$\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \dfrac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$

Notice that if $g(x) = x$ then $g'(x) = 1$ and the above equation
becomes the original mean value theorem you saw previously in
[[file:section2.org][section 2]].
