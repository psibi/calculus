* Increasing and Decreasing functions

** Definition 4.3.1

Let $f$ be a function and $I$ an interval contained in the domain of
$f$.

- We say that $f$ is strictly increasing on $I$ if for all numbers
  $x_1, x_2 \in I$, if $x_1 < x_2$ then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$
- We say that $f$ is weakly increasing on $I$ if for all numbers
  $x_1, x_2 \in I$, if $x_1 < x_2$ then $f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)$
- We say that $f$ is strictly decreasing on $I$ if for all numbers
  $x_1, x_2 \in I$, if $x_1 < x_2$ then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$
- We say that $f$ is weakly decreasing on $I$ if for all numbers
  $x_1, x_2 \in I$, if $x_1 < x_2$ then $f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)$
- We say that $f$ is constant on $I$ if for all numbers $x_1, x_2 \in
  I$, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$

** Theorem 4.3.2

Suppose $f$ is containous on an interval $I$ and differentiable on the
interior of $I$.

- If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ in the interior of $I$, then $f$ is
  strictly increasing on $I$.
- If $f'(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$ in the interior of $I$, then $f$ is
  weakly increasing on $I$.
- If $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$ in the interior of $I$, then $f$ is
  strictly decreasing on $I$.
- If $f'(x) \leq 0$ for all $x$ in the interior of $I$, then $f$ is
  weakly decreasing on $I$.
- If $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in the interior of $I$, then $f$ is
  constant on $I$.

** Definition 4.3.3

Suppose that $f$ is a function and $a$ is a number in the domain of
$f$.

- Suppose that for every $x$ in the domain of $f$, $f(a) \leq
  f(x)$. Then we say that $f(a)$ is the *minimum value* of $f$. We
  also say that $f$ attains its minimum value at $a$.
- Suppose that for every $x$ in the domain of $f$, $f(a) \geq
  f(x)$. Then we say that $f(a)$ is the *maximum value* of $f$. We
  also say that $f$ attains its maximum value at $a$.

Additional points:

- Not every function has maximum and miniumum values.

** Definition 4.3.4

Suppose $f$ is a function, $S$ is a subset of the domain of $f$, and
$a \in S$.

- Suppose that for every $x \in S$, $f(a) \leq f(x)$. Then we say that
  $f(a)$ is the *minimum* value of $f$ on $S$. We also say that $f$
  attains its minimum value on the set $S$ at $a$.
- Suppose that for every $x \in S$, $f(a) \geq f(x)$. Then we say that
  $f(a)$ is the *maximum* value of $f$ on $S$. We also say that $f$
  attains its maximum value on the set $S$ at $a$.

** Definition 4.3.5

Suppose $f$ is a function and $a$ is a number in the domain of $f$.

- We say that $f$ has a *local minimum* at $a$ if there is some number
  $d > 0$ such that the interval $(a-d, a+d)$ is contained in the
  domain of $f$, and $f$ attains its minimum value on $(a-d,a+d)$ at
  $a$.
- We say that $f$ has a *local maximum* at $a$ if there is some $d>0$
  such that the interval $(a-d,a+d)$ is contained in the domain of
  $f$, and $f$ attains its maximum value on $(a-d,a+d)$ at $a$.

** Theorem 4.3.6

Suppose $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $a$. Then either $f$ is
not differentiable at $a$ or $f'(a) = 0$.

** Definition 4.3.7

A number $a$ in the domain of $f$ such that either $f'(a)$ is
undefined or $f'(a)=0$ is called a *critical number* of $f$.

** Theorem 4.3.8 (First Derivative Test)

Suppose that $f$ is continous at $a$, and for some number $d>0$, $f$
is differentiable on the intervals $(a-d,a)$ and $(a,a+d)$.

- Suppose that for every number $x$, if $a-d < x < a$ then $f'(x) <
  0$, and if $a < x < a + d$ then $f'(x) > 0$. Then $f$ has a local
  minimum at $a$.
- Suppose that for every number $x$, if $a-d < x < a$ then $f'(x) >
  0$, and if $a < x < a + d$ then $f'(x) < 0$. Then $f$ has a local
  maximum at $a$.

Notes:

- A function need not have a local maximum or minimu at a critical
  number.
