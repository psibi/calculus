* The Mean Value Theorem

** Theorem 4.2.1 (Mean Value Theorem)

Suppose $f$ is continous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and
differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then there is a number $c$ such that $a < c
< b$ and

$\dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)$

** Lemma 4.2.2

Suppose that $f$ is continous on $[u,v]$. Then there are numbers $u'$
and $v'$ such that $u < u' < v' < v, v'-u' = (u-v)/3$, and

$\dfrac{f(v')-f(u')}{v'-u'} = \dfrac{f(v)-f(u)}{v-u}$

** Lemma 4.2.3

Suppose that $f$ is differentiable at $c$, and
$\{u_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and $\{v_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ are sequences
such that as $n \to \infty$, $u_n \to c^{-}$ and $v_n \to c^{+}$. Then

$\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{f(v_n) - f(u_n)}{v_n - u_n} = f'(c)$
