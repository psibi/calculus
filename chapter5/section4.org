* The fundamental theorems of Calculus

** Theorem 5.4.1 (First fundamental theorems of Calculus)

Suppose $f$ is continous on an interval $I$ and $a \in I$. For all $x
\in I$ let

$F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \mathrm{d}t$

Then $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $I$.

** Corollary 5.4.2

Suppose $f$ is continous on an interval $I$. Then $f$ has an
antiderivative on $I$.

** Theorem 5.4.3 (Second fundamental theorems of Calculus)

Suppose $f$ is a function that is continous on an interval $I$ and $f$
is an antiderivative of $f$ on $I$. Then for any numbers $a$ and $b$
in $I$,

$\int_a^b f(x) mathrm{d}x = F(b) - F(a)$
