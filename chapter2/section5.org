* Variations on Limits

** Definition 2.5.7

To say that as $x \to \infty$, $f(x) \to L$ means that for every
$\epsilon > 0$ there is some N such that if $x > N$ then $|f(x) - L| <
\epsilon$. We defined $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$ to be the unique
number $L$ such that as $x \to \infty$, $f(x) \to L$, if there is such
a number L.

(Here we can think $\epsilon$ as challenge and $N$ as the reponse for
it)

** Definition 2.5.8

To say that as $x \to -\infty$, $f(x) \to L$ means that for every
$\epsilon > 0$ there is some N such that if $x < N$ then $|f(x) - L| <
\epsilon$. We defined $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x)$ to be the unique
number $L$ such that as $x \to -\infty$, $f(x) \to L$, if there is such
a number L.
