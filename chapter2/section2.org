  - Has definition on infinite limits too.

** Definition 2.2.3

For any function $f$ and numbers $a$ and $L$, we write "as $x \to
a^{\neq}, f(x) \to L$" to mean that for every number $\epsilon > 0$,
there is some corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x -
a| < \delta$ then $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$

** Theorem 2.2.4

There cannot be more than one number $L$ such that as "x \to a^{\neq},
f(x) \to L".

** Definition 2.2.5

If there is a number $L$ such that as $x \to a^{\neq}, f(x) \to L$,
then we defined $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ to be the unique such number
$L$. If there is no such number $L$, then $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ is
undefined.
