* Continuity

** Definition 2.7.1

Suppose that $f$ is a function and $a$ is a number. We say that $f$ is
continous at $a$ if $f(a)$ is defined, $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ is
defined and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.

** Continuity on Open Interval (Definition 2.7.2)

We say that a function $f$ is continous on open interval $I$ if for
every $a \in I$, $f$ is continous at a.

** Theorem on compositions of functions (Definition 2.7.3)

Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continous at $a$. Then so are $f + g$, $f -
g$, and $f.g$. If $g(a) \neq 0$, then $f/g$ is also continous at a.

** One sided version of continuity (Definition 2.7.4)

We say that $f$ is continous from the right at $a$ if $f(a)$ is
defined, $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$ is defined, and $\lim_{x \to a^+}
f(x) = f(a)$. We say that $f$ is continous from the left at $a$ if
$f(a)$ is defined, $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$ is defined, and $\lim_{x
\to a^-} f(x) = f(a)$.

** Continuity on Closed Interval (Definition 2.7.5)

We say that a function $f$ is continous on a closed interval $[a,b]$
if it is continous on $(a,b)$, continous fom the right at $a$, and
continous from the left at $b$.

** Intermediate Value Theorem (Theorem 2.7.6)

Suppose that $f$ is continous on the interval $[a,b]$ and either $f(a)
< r < f(b)$ or $f(a) > r > f(b)$. Then there is some number $c$ such
that $a < c < b$ and $f(c) = r$.

** Theorem 2.7.8

Let $n$ be any positive integer and let $f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$

- If $n$ is even, then $f$ is continous on $[0, \infty)$
- If $n$ is odd, then $f$ is continous on $(-\infty, \infty)$

** Lemma 2.7.9

For any numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$,

$|cos \beta - cos \alpha| \leq | \beta - \alpha|$, $|sin \beta - sin \alpha| \leq | \beta - \alpha|$

** Trignometric theorem (Theorem 2.7.10)

All of the trignometric functions are continous everywhere they are
defined.

** Theorem 2.7.11

Suppose that $f$ is continous at $a$. Then as $x \to a$, $f(x) \to
f(a)$. In other words, for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is some $\delta
> 0$ such that if $|x - a| < \delta$ then $|f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon$

** Theorem 2.7.12

- If $f$ is continous from the left at $a$, then as $x \to a^{\leq}$,
  $f(x) \to f(a)$
- If $f$ is continous from the right at $a$, then as $x \to a^{\geq}$,
  $f(x) \to f(a)$

** Theorem 2.7.13

1. Suppose that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = L$ and $f$ is continous at
   $L$. Then $\lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = f(L)$.
2. Supppose that $g$ is continous at $a$ and $f$ is continous at
   $g(a)$. Then $f \circ g$ is continous at $a$.
3. Suppose that $g$ is continous on an interval $J$, $f$ is continous
   on an interval $I$, and for every $x \in J$, $g(x) \in I$. Then $f
   \circ g$ is continous on $J$.
